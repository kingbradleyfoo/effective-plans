# Information Security (InfoSec)
InfoSec is the practice of protecting digital information from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves a range of measures, including policies, procedures, technologies, and training programs, to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

InfoSec is essential for businesses, governments, and individuals to protect their sensitive and confidential information from cyber threats, such as hacking, malware, phishing, and social engineering attacks. Information security professionals are responsible for implementing and managing security controls to safeguard digital assets and mitigate risks. They use a range of tools and techniques, such as firewalls, encryption, access controls, vulnerability scanning, and incident response, to protect information systems and data.

InfoSec is a constantly evolving field due to the emergence of new threats and vulnerabilities. It requires professionals to stay up-to-date with the latest developments and best practices in the industry, and obtain relevant certifications, such as Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), or CompTIA Security+.

I recommend: **CISSP** and **CISM**

## Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
CISSP stands for Certified Information Systems Security Professional. It is a globally recognized certification in the field of information security, offered by the International Information Systems Security Certification Consortium, or (ISC)Â². CISSP certification validates the knowledge and skills of professionals in the field of information security, covering topics such as security and risk management, asset security, security architecture and engineering, communication and network security, identity and access management, security assessment and testing, security operations, and software development security. The certification process involves passing a six-hour, 250-question exam and meeting experience and ethics requirements. CISSP certification is highly valued in the information security industry and is often a requirement for senior-level positions.

## Certified Information Security Manager (CISM)
CISM stands for Certified Information Security Manager, which is a professional certification in information security management. It is offered by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), which is a global association for information security professionals.

The CISM certification is designed for IT professionals who are responsible for managing, designing, and overseeing an organization's information security program. It is a vendor-neutral certification that covers four domains: Information Security Governance, Information Risk Management and Compliance, Information Security Program Development and Management, and Information Security Incident Management.

To obtain the CISM certification, candidates must have at least five years of experience in information security management and pass the CISM exam, which consists of 150 multiple-choice questions. The certification must be renewed every three years through continuing education or retaking the exam.

Once you certified CISM, you will receive the badge from Credly:
