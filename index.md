# What is it for me?
A career development plan is a roadmap that outlines an individual's goals and objectives for their professional growth and development. It typically includes a self-assessment of skills, interests, and values, as well as specific steps to achieve career goals. The plan can include short-term goals such as learning a new skill, and long-term goals such as pursuing a promotion or changing careers. It may also include strategies for networking, education, and mentoring to support the individual's career aspirations. A career development plan helps individuals take control of their professional growth and create a plan to achieve their career objectives, and can be updated and revised as needed to reflect changing goals and circumstances.
